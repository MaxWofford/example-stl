Example STL
---
This is an example stl for me to play with GitHub's stl viewer. 

This space-station is a quick combination of two models I was working on (quickly stuck together to put on github). The original inspiration comes from [this](http://www.deviantart.com/art/QR-Space-Station-409679731) and [this](http://images.wikia.com/halo/images/archive/a/a9/20110815182736!Heart_of_Midlothian.png). I'll upload more finalized versions later.
